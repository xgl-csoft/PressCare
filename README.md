# PressCare
PressCare+ is a SwiftUI iOS app that digitizes Traditional Chinese Medicine. It uses ARKit's body tracking to overlay 3D acupoint markers onto the user in real-time. A custom algorithm analyzes symptoms against a database of 77 acupoints to provide personalized recommendations, with Core Data managing local persistence for user tracking.
